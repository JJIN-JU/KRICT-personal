# KRICT Personal Research Projects

This repository contains personal projects related to computational drug discovery and cheminformatics developed while working at the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT), Infectious Disease Therapeutics Research Center.
The work focuses on applying machine learning and structural analysis methods to small-molecule drug discovery problems, including ADMET prediction and protein–ligand binding affinity modeling.
Each project is organized in separate directories within this repository for clarity.

### Ligand–Pocket Binding Affinity Model
Development of a deep learning model to predict ligand–protein binding affinity using structural information.

Key features:
- Ligand embedding generation
- Protein pocket feature extraction from PDB structures
- Attention-based interaction modeling
- Binding affinity regression using the PDBbind dataset
